# Secure Control of Networked Control Systems Using Dynamic Watermarking
## Introduction
We have investigated secure control of networked control systems developing a new dynamic watermarking (DW) scheme. Here, we release the code of our paper for the new DW scheme used in the networked inverted pendulum visual servo systems (NIPVSSs). 
## Demo and data
The demo is divided into 2 folders in <code>SCNCSDW_code</code> using the MATLAB. Run the .m file in the every folders. The requried data is included in the every folders too.
## Ethical proof
All experimental procedures were approved by the Shanghai Key Laboratory of Power Station Automation Technology, School of Mechatronical Engineering and Automation, Shanghai University, Shanghai 200444, China.
